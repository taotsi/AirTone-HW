# Intro
This is supposed to be a wireless and lossless audio transceiver designed for electric instruments. 
It stopped a year ago however because I became a postgraduate and have been busy with other things.
Nevertheless I'll continue this project as long as I got time. About 1000 lines codes to go, I guess.

This is the hardware part. For the software part, go there please:[AirTone-SW](https://github.com/taotsi/AirTone-SW)
